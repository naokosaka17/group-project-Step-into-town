<br>
<b>A self guided walking tour of divided areas within a specific city that provides a day filled of places to eat, things to do, shops and unique finds--all within walking distance of each other.</b>
<br>
<p>I did this project with other 3 people and I worked google maps in this project.<br>
- Changed google maps style for looks good(remove some buttons and change water, airport and park color).
- Search bar moved to outside of the map.
- Set search bar autocomplete so it works worldwide.
- Make on click function for each activities and also set the same color of navbar and markers.
- Each marker is clickable and show each activitie's information.
